This project uses an API to display a contact list. 
Using this application, you can add a new contact by clicking on the "Add Contact" button, which will make an API call to a random and unique user from the given API and add it to the list. 
In addition, you can sort the list by A-Z first name, Z-A first name or by days until birthday. 
On each contact card, you can see that the picture frame is colored according to the gender of that contact, green for a woman, red for a man. 
For each contact, there are two more buttons - "remove" and "more information". The first is to delete the contact from the list, and the second is to discover more information about him.
While the contact list is empty, the screen will display "The list is empty!". 
The app will alert you if something went wrong and it failed to fetch the new contact.
Try refreshing! As we store the current state of the app in the local storage every time you press "add contact", the current state will not disappear.
